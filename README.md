<h1 align="center">Hello, there👋</h1>

## I'm a 23 year old self-taught programmer and 3D artist from Florida

**✨ My first programming experience:** using websites like [code.org](https://code.org/) in middle and high school, but it was mainly just the basics of HTML and some Python if I remember correctly. I didn't stick with it, but

My first time programming on my own was in September 2022, in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) as my editor. I was a few years into Linux distro-hopping and getting comfortable with the terminal when I saw a video that made me want to build a robot with a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). In the midst of diving down that rabbit-hole, I stumbled upon the world of microcontrollers. I bought some [RP2040](https://raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040)

I haven't made a robot (yet), but I am much closer to being able to now that I know what it takes in terms of both hardware and software.

I got into [Blender](https://blender.org/) just after version 2.8 released in 2019. I mainly focus on photorealism and outer-space scenes

**📚 I'm currently learning:** C, Python, HTML+CSS+JS,

**🎯 My current goals:** keep learning Python until I can create all the projects I want with it, then move on to another language like C and do the same, pimp out [my website](https://loganr914.github.io/) and write an open-source online game that can be played via a server or peer-to-peer.

**🎲 Fun fact:** I broke my left arm 3 times in the year 2015. All while skateboarding, at the same skatepark, within just over a 6 month timespan. I was 12 when I broke my elbow (ulna) on June 12th, then 3 months after I turned 13, I broke my wrist (ulna and radius at the same time) on December 23rd. Those are the only bones I've ever broken, and breaking my wrist is still the worst physical pain I've ever felt.
