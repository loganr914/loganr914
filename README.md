<h1 align="center">Hello, there👋</h1>

## I'm a 23 year old self-taught programmer and 3D artist from Florida

**✨ My first programming experience:** using websites like [code.org](https://code.org/) in middle and high school, but it wasn't much past "Hello, world!" in Python and writing a basic webpage in HTML. I enjoyed it, but I guess we didn't dive deep enough for me to stick with it back then. I got into [Blender](https://blender.org/) in 2019, just after version 2.8 released. I mainly focus on photorealism and outer-space scenes, though I occasionally attempt to make stylized scenes and game assets.

My first time programming on my own was in September 2022, when I saw a video that gave me the idea to build an AI/machine-learning powered autonomous robot with a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). In the midst of diving down that rabbit-hole, I stumbled upon the world of microcontrollers and was instantly fascinated. I made the decision to use the Pi 4 as a desktop and bought some [RP2040](https://raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040) boards instead of going straight into trying to build an autonomous and intelligent robot. I haven't made a robot (yet), but now I know what it takes in terms of both hardware and software development.

**📚 I'm currently learning:** Python, C, HTML+CSS, JavaScript (deep sigh), Bash scripting and Hyprland.

**🎯 My current goals:** focus on learning more Python until I can't be stumped on a question, then move on to another language and do the same, pimp out [my website](https://loganr914.github.io/) and develop an open-source GTA-like online game with more free-roam activities and realistic .

**🎲 Fun fact:** I broke my left arm 3 times in the year 2015. All while skateboarding, all at the same skatepark, all within a 6 and a half month timespan. I broke my elbow (ulna bone) on June 12th at 12 years old, then 3 months after I turned 13, I broke my wrist (ulna and radius at the same time) on December 23rd. Those are the only bones I've ever broken, and breaking my wrist is still the worst physical pain I've ever felt.
