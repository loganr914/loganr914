## About me

#### My name is Logan, I'm a self-taught programmer, game developer and Linux user from Florida.

âœ¨ My first programming experience was in computer class in high school, writing simple CLI programs on code.org in Python, but I didn't stick with it at the time because I didn't like school (still don't). My first real programming experience outside of school was around October 2022, I can't remember the exact YouTube video I saw, but it made me want to learn how to program microcontrollers to make robots and bought a few [Raspberry Pi RP2040](https://raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/) boards, some monochrome OLED I2C displays, and a sensor kit. I started my programming with those boards and displays in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). I wrote a few little programs where I draw shapes on the displays, switch the colors of an RGB LED with a button, and play musical notes through a buzzer speaker.

I didn't make very much progress with MicroPython, but spending that time and effort to understand and do it myself definitely laid the foundations for my eventual return to programming. That return happened in September of 2024, when I started stumbled upon [raylib](https://raylib.com/), which showed me that making games alone is much more achievable than I originally thought. Since then, I've been writing little prototypes of apps and games that I keep interating on and refactoring as I learn new concepts. 

ðŸ“š I'm currently learning as much Python as I can before I move on to lower-level languages like C or Odin, as well as refreshing my webdev knowledge and learning Javascript just for [my personal website](https://loganr914.github.io/)

ðŸŽ¯ My current goals are to keep learning Python and whatever other languages and concepts I come across, pimp out [my website](https://loganr914.github.io/) and turn [pyray-2d-template](https://github.com/loganr914/pyray-2d-template/) into a decent starting point for beginner Python game devs using raylib.

ðŸŽ² Fun fact: In the year 2015, I broke my left arm 3 times while skateboarding. It all happened at the same skatepark, just over 6 months apart. The first break was on June 12th, my elbow (ulna bone), then, on December 23rd, a double-whammy on my wrist (ulna and radius). To this day, those are the only bones I've ever broken.
