## About me

#### My name is Logan, and I'm a self-taught programmer/game developer from Florida.

âœ¨ My first programming experience was with MicroPython in 2022, when I discovered microcontrollers and bought a few Raspberry Pi RP2040 boards to tinker with. I played around with them for a little while, but didn't make much progress in understanding how to code or how it all works. I also got into 3D modelling and printing around that same time, but after a few successes, I had too many issues with my printer destroying what it was supposed to create. That was when I realized the value of digital creation.

I started writing vanilla Python consistently around September of 2024 and have been writing small programs to test myself at least twice a week since then.

ðŸ“š I'm currently learning as much Python as I can before I dive into a lower-level language like C or Zig, as well as refreshing my webdev knowledge for [my website](https://loganr914.github.io/my-website/)

ðŸŽ¯ My current goals are to keep absorbing knowledge, pimp out [my website](https://loganr914.github.io/my-website/) and finish [pyray-2d-template](https://github.com/loganr914/pyray-2d-template/)

ðŸŽ² Fun fact: In 2015, I broke my left arm 3 times while skateboarding, almost within a 6 month timespan, all at the same skatepark. The first time was at the elbow (ulna bone), then two bones at once at the wrist (ulna and radius bones). To this day, those are the only broken bones I've ever had. Maybe it was just an unlucky year?
